I've recently been expierimenting with implementations of style transfer. These techniques could be useful for video effects in the very near future. Here is a still from Carbon's Essilor spot in the style of Kandinsky. This was made with [cysmith's](https://github.com/cysmith) Tensor Flow implementation of [Neural Style](https://github.com/cysmith/neural-style-tf)
