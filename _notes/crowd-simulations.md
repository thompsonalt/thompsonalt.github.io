### Important note on importing animations from Mixamo
This is an annoying one... It turns out, if you download an FBX from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) and import it into Houdini using the FBX importing tool it leaves off frame zero of the animation. This is unfortunate because houdini expects the first and last frames of a looping agent animation to be identical. To work around this, I ended up importing the FBX out of Mixamo into Maya, offseting all the animation one frame forward, and re-exporting the FBX. 

**To offset all the animation in an FBX forward in Maya:**
- Import FBX and select it in the Outliner
- `[Select > Hierarchy]` to select all the keyframes
- Shift, left click and hold the first frame of the animation on the timeline and drag to the end.
- Grab the arrows in the center of the red selection area and drag one frame to the right.
- Re-export the FBX with `[File > Export All]`
