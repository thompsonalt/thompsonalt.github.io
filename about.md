I am a VFX artist and tool developer based in Chicago, Illinois currently working at [Framestore Chicago](https://www.framestore.com/?language=en). This website has a collection of my notes and resources primarily regarding VFX and pipeline development. I specialize in Nuke compositing and Houdini FX with significant experience in Python tool development.

This is hosted using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) on [Github](https://github.com/thompsonalt/thompsonalt.github.io).
